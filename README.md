## Running the Game
The project has been tested on Windows 10 and Windows 11, which are the recommended operating systems for running the game.
To run the game, you will need the Python interpreter (version 3.10 or higher) and the Pygame module (at least version 2.1).

To launch the game, run the `main.py` file using the Python interpreter.

The program leaves the `properties.py` file open for users to adjust game physics, although it is not recommended.
